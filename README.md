<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The Uber Trip Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization and analytics project designed to provide actionable insights into Uber ride data. Built using a business intelligence tool (likely Power BI or Tableau, based on the interface), this project analyzes key metrics related to Uber trips, including booking patterns, trip distances, booking values, vehicle types, and location-based trends. The dashboard is divided into three main sections—Overview, Time Analysis, and Details—each offering a unique perspective on the data to support operational and strategic decision-making for stakeholders.

## Key Features

- **Overview Page: Key Metrics Snapshot**  
The Overview page provides a concise summary of Uber trip performance, displaying critical metrics such as Total Bookings (103.7K), Total Booking Value ($1.6M), Average Booking Value ($15.0), Total Trip Distance (349K miles), Average Trip Distance (3 miles), and Average Trip Time (16 minutes) for a quick, at-a-glance understanding of overall activity.

- **Overview Page: Navigation and Breakdowns**  
The Overview page includes intuitive navigation to other sections (Time Analysis and Details) and detailed breakdowns like Total Booking Value by Payment Type (e.g., Uber Pay at 55.8%) and Trip Type (Day vs. Night), alongside Vehicle Type Analysis, helping users understand payment trends, trip patterns, and vehicle preferences.

- **Time Analysis Page: Temporal Insights**  
The Time Analysis page visualizes booking patterns over time with a histogram of Total Bookings by Pickup Time (peaking at 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM), a line chart of Total Bookings by Day Name, and a heatmap of bookings by hour and day, enabling users to identify peak demand periods and optimize resource allocation.

- **Location Analysis: Geographic Trends**  
This feature highlights the most frequent pickup and drop-off locations (e.g., Penn Station/Madison Sq West for pickups, Upper East Side North for drop-offs) and preferred vehicle types by location (e.g., Uber Black in Upper West Side with 3.8K bookings), using bar charts to support location-specific operational strategies.

- **Details Page: Granular Trip Data**  
The Details page offers a comprehensive table of individual trips, including Trip ID, Pickup Date, Vehicle Type, Payment Type, Trip Distance, Booking Value, and Locations, with a summary row showing totals (e.g., 146,781 passengers, $1,555,672.8 in booking value), allowing for in-depth trip-level analysis.


<h2>Tech Stack </h2>

- Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Power Query (M Language) – Data transformation and cleaning.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculated fields.


<h2>Why This Project? </h2>

This project was developed to assist Uber's operational teams in understanding ride patterns, optimizing vehicle allocation, and improving customer experience. By identifying peak hours, popular locations, and preferred vehicle types, the dashboard enables data-driven decisions to enhance service efficiency and profitability. It also provides insights into payment trends, helping to refine payment processing strategies.
